        <b>Equipment Needed:</b>
        <br/>-A cricket ball and bat/gears
        <br/>-Stumps (3 vertical sticks) and bails (2 small sticks on top)
        <br/>-A field (usually oval) with a 22-yard pitch in the center<br/>

        <br/><b>Roles:</b> 
        <br/>Each team gets to bat and bowl/field per game and each team has 11 players.
        <br/>-Batting Team: Scores runs
        <br/>-Bowling/Fielding Team: Tries to limit runs and dismiss the batsmen<br/>

        <br/><b>Starting the Game:</b><br/>
        -Toss: Captains of both teams flip a coin to decide which team will bat or bowl first.<br/>
        -Setting Up the Pitch: Place stumps on both ends of the 22-yard pitch.<br/>

        <br/><b>Playing the Game:</b>
        <br/>-Bowling:
        <br/>&nbsp;A bowler delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the batsman at the other.
        <br/>&nbsp;The bowler must bowl overarm and keep their front foot behind the crease line.<br/>

        <br/>-Batting:
        <br/>&nbsp;The batsman tries to hit the ball and score runs
        <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Runs are scored by running between the wickets or by hitting the ball to the boundary: <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-4 runs if the ball rolls to the boundary.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-6 runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground.<br/>

        <br/>-Fielding:<br/>
        Fielders stop the ball, catch it, or throw it to hit the stumps to get the batsman out.<br/>
        <br/>-Ways To Get Out:
        <br/>&nbsp;Bowled: The ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails.<br/>
        <br/>&nbsp;Caught: A fielder catches the ball before it touches the ground.<br/>
        <br/>&nbsp;Run Out: A fielder hits the stumps while the batsman is running between the wickets.<br/>
        <br/>&nbsp;LBW (Leg Before Wicket): The ball hits the batsman's leg in line with the stumps.<br/>
        <br/>&nbsp;Stumped: The wicketkeeper dislodges the bails when the batsman is outside the crease.<br/>
        <br/><b>Scoring and Winning:</b>
        <br/>-Innings: Each team gets one or two turns (innings) to bat, depending on the format (Test, ODI, or T20).<br/>
        <br/>-Run Target: The team batting second tries to score more runs than the first team.<br/>
        <br/>-Win Conditions: Team with the most runs wins.
        <br/>&nbsp;In cricket, a tie may occur if both teams score the same runs then they will go to a super over, where each team has to score the most amount of runs in one over (6 balls).<br/>
        <br/><b>Formats of Cricket:</b>
        <br/>-Test Match: Played over five days with two innings per team.<br/>
        <br/>-One Day International (ODI): 50 overs (300 balls) per team.
        <br/>-T20: 20 overs (120 balls) per team.
